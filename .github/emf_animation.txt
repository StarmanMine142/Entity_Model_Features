@ Entity Model Features Animations
@ Reference configuration for EMF's Custom Entity Models
@
@ Adapted from the original OptiFine spec:
@ https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/cem_animation.txt
@
@ Lines starting with @ are EMF only features
# whereas lines starting with # are OptiFine & EMF features
######################################################################
# Each model variable which is to be animated is assigned an expression. 
# The expression is evaluated every time the model is rendered and its value is assigned to the variable.
# The variables and expressions are defined in the "animation" section of the json entity model (JEM).
@ EMF also allows storing animations within .jpm files, which can be referenced by multiple entities.
#  
#  "animations":
#  [
#    {
#      "variable1": "expression1",    
#      "variable2": "expression2,
#      ...
#    }
#  ]
# 
# 
# Variables
#
# Model variables are specified in the format 
#   "<model>.<variable_name>"
#
# The model can be:
#  "this" - current custom model
#  "part" - the original part model to which the custom model is attached
#  "<part>" - original model by part name  
#  "<id>" - custom model by ID
#  "<part>:<sub_id>:<sub_sub_id>:..." - (hierarchical) start with original model by part name, then find children by ID
#  "<id>:<sub_id>:<sub_sub_id>:..." - (hierarchical) start with model by ID, then find children by ID
#
# The first model found by part name or ID is used if there are duplicates.
# The model search by ID is deep, also when used in a hierarchical specification. 
#
# The hierarchical specification allows model groups (json part models) to be reused for different parts. 
# For example one hand model ("shoulder:upper_arm:elbow:forearm:palm:finger[1.5]" can be used for both left and right hand.
# The animation can use "left_hand:finger1" for the left thumb and "right_hand:finger1" for the right thumb. 
# The intermediate parents in the hierarchical specification can be skipped. 
#
# Variable names
#   tx, ty, tz    - Translation x, y, z
#   rx, ry, rz    - Rotation x, y, z
#   sx, sy, sz    - Scale x, y, z
#   visible       - Show model and submodels (boolean)
#   visible_boxes - Show model only, does not affect submodels (boolean)
#
# Entity variables
#
# Entity variables are specified in the format "var.<name>" (float) or "varb.<name>" (boolean) 
# The name can be any string, for example "var.xyz", "var.last_rx", etc.
# The variable is attached to the rendered entity and has a default value 0 or false.
# Entity variables are useful for storing animation data between frames.
@ In EMF this is supported for block entities.
#
@ Global variables
@
@ Global variables are specified in the format "global_var.<name>" (float) or "global_varb.<name>" (boolean)
@ The name can be any string, for example "global_var.xyz", "global_var.last_rx", etc.
@ The variable is saved globally and has a default value 0 or false.
@ Global variables are useful for storing animation data to be accessed by many entities.
#
# Render variables
#   render.shadow_size                                                  - The size of the shadow underneath an entity
#   render.shadow_opacity                                               - How transparent the shadow is
#   render.shadow_offset_x, render.shadow_offset_z                      - The location of the shadow
#   render.leash_offset_x, render.leash_offset_y, render.leash_offset_z - The position of the point the leash attaches to

#
@ Note about booleans in EMF:
@ Unlike OptiFine, EMF internally uses Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY for false, and Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY for true.
@ This streamlines the underlying math code and makes it easier to use booleans in expressions, the math will still warn
@ you when using a numbers where a boolean is expected.
@ However, for the interest of performance, the reverse check is not done and booleans may be used in place of numbers.
@ Such cases will almost always result in a NaN value at the end and will usually zero out the expression, but I cannot guarantee this.

# Examples:
#    ...
#    "animations":
#    [
#      {
#        "this.rx": "clamp(-0.5 * part.rx, 0, 90)",
#        "this.tx": "3 * sin(limb_swing / 4) - 2",
#        "this:Hoof.rx": "if(leg4:Hoof.rx > 90, leg4:Hoof.rx - 90, 0)"
#        ...
#      }
#    ]
#    
# Walking animation:
#    x is a multiplier to control how fast the leg swings back and forth, and y is a multiplier to control how far it swings back and forth
@    This is a matter of modifying a wave function (sin()), you will have a much easier time if you can understand how to modify a wave function
@    I would highly recommend looking up YouTube tutorials for beginners it is much easier than it may appear at first glance.
#
#    "left_leg.rx": "sin(limb_swing*x)*limb_speed*y"
# 
# Attack animation:
#    x is a multipler for how much it rotates
#
#    "head.rx": "sin(swing_progress*pi)*x"
#
# Hurt animation:
#    x is a multipler for how much it rotates
#
#    "head.rx": "-sin(hurt_time/pi)*x"
#
# Custom counter:
#    This is a counter that will count up while an entity is in water, and count down again when it leaves
#
#    "var.counter": "if(is_in_water, min(20, var.counter + 0.1 * frame_time * 20), max(0, var.counter - 0.1 * frame_time * 20))"
#
@ Value history stack:
@   This is a stack of variables that hold a previous value for several frames
@   This specific example will result in "var.x1" having the value that "pos_x" was 10 frames prior
@   This can be used to create a delay effect, or to compare a value to what it was in the past
@   Note: this does not work in the reverse order as they are processed in the order they are defined
@
@    "var.x1": "var.x2"
@    "var.x2": "var.x3"
@    "var.x3": "var.x4"
@    "var.x4": "var.x5"

@ Loop through preset values
@   This is a keyframe-like loop that will interpolate between 5, 10, 15, (the result of sin(head_pitch)), 25, 30, 35, (the value of age), 45, 50, and back to 5.
@   Each frame of the keyframe method will align with every whole number of the first input "var.seconds" which is every second
@   so the whole thing loops every 10 seconds
